## Common Mistakes ‚ùå

### 1. Wrong Variable Names
‚ùå `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
‚úÖ `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`

**Important:** Must start with `VITE_` for Vite projects!

### 2. Forgot to Redeploy
- Adding variables doesn't automatically update the live site
- You MUST redeploy after adding environment variables

### 3. Wrong Environment Selected
- Make sure to check "Production" when adding variables
- Or check all three: Production, Preview, Development

### 4. Typos in Values
- Double-check your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
- Copy directly from EmailJS dashboard to avoid typos
