# üî¥ DEBUGGING: Form Not Working

## Current Error
**"Failed to send message - Please try again or contact us directly at intelleeo.inteligence@gmail.com"**

## Current Configuration
- Service ID: `service_8ybnnqf` (keeps changing - this is a problem!)
- Template ID: `template_jimyz9p`
- Public Key: `oFWfmVYrfd9GxkZzB`

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Service ID Keeps Changing ‚ö†Ô∏è
You've created multiple services:
- First: `service_db3a84c`
- Second: `service_44x3eyk`
- Third: `service_8ybnnqf` (current)

**Problem:** You're creating new services instead of connecting Gmail to the existing one!

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECT WAY TO FIX THIS

### Step 1: Go to Email Services List
1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin
2. Click on **"Email Services"** in the left menu
3. You'll see a list of all your services

### Step 2: Find Your Active Service
Look for the service with ID: `service_8ybnnqf`
- Is it marked as "Active" or "Connected"?
- Is there a green checkmark?
- Or does it say "Not connected" or show an error?

### Step 3: Connect Gmail to This Service
1. Click on the service `service_8ybnnqf`
2. You should see the config page
3. Look for "Connect Account" button
4. Click it and sign in with **intelleeo.inteligence@gmail.com**
5. Allow permissions
6. Save the service

### Step 4: Verify the Template
1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates
2. Find template: `template_jimyz9p`
3. Click on it to edit
4. **Make sure it has these EXACT variables:**

**Subject:**
```
New Contact from {{from_name}}
```

**Content (HTML or Text):**
```
Hello,

You have a new contact form submission!

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Project Type: {{project_type}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
Sent from intelleeo.com
```

5. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure the template is **ACTIVE** (not draft)
6. Click "Save"

### Step 5: Get Your Public Key
1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account
2. Find "Public Key" section
3. Copy the key
4. Verify it matches: `oFWfmVYrfd9GxkZzB`

## üß™ Alternative: Test with EmailJS Dashboard

Before testing on your site, test directly in EmailJS:

1. Go to your template: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates/template_jimyz9p
2. Click the **"Test It"** button (if available)
3. Fill in test values
4. Send test email
5. Check if you receive it at intelleeo.inteligence@gmail.com

If the test works in EmailJS but not on your site, it's a configuration issue.
If the test doesn't work in EmailJS, it's a Gmail connection issue.

## üîß Quick Fix: Start Fresh

If nothing works, let's start completely fresh:

### Option 1: Delete Old Services and Create One Properly

1. **Delete old services:**
   - Go to Email Services
   - Delete `service_db3a84c` (if exists)
   - Delete `service_44x3eyk` (if exists)
   - Keep only `service_8ybnnqf`

2. **Properly configure the remaining service:**
   - Click on `service_8ybnnqf`
   - Click "Connect Account"
   - Sign in with Gmail
   - Allow permissions
   - Save

### Option 2: Use a Different Email Service (Simpler)

Instead of EmailJS, we can use Formspree (much simpler):

1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Get the form endpoint
5. I'll update your Contact.tsx to use it

## üîç Debug Checklist

Check each item:

- [ ] Gmail account **intelleeo.inteligence@gmail.com** is connected to EmailJS service
- [ ] Service `service_8ybnnqf` shows as "Active" or "Connected"
- [ ] Template `template_jimyz9p` exists and is **Active** (not draft)
- [ ] Template has all required variables: `{{from_name}}`, `{{from_email}}`, `{{project_type}}`, `{{message}}`
- [ ] Public key `oFWfmVYrfd9GxkZzB` is correct
- [ ] Dev server restarted after changing `.env`
- [ ] No browser console errors (press F12 to check)

---

## üö® Most Common Mistakes

1. **Not connecting Gmail** - Service created but Gmail not authenticated
2. **Template in draft mode** - Must be "Active"
3. **Wrong variable names** - Must match exactly: `{{from_name}}` not `{{name}}`
4. **Not restarting server** - Changes to `.env` need server restart
5. **Creating multiple services** - Stick to one and configure it properly
