## Current Status ✅
- Service ID: `service_db3a84c` ✅
- Template ID: `template_jimyz9p` ✅  
- Public Key: `oFWfmVYrfd9GxkZzB` ✅
- `.env` file configured ✅

## ❌ Problem Found:

From your screenshot, I can see **"Please connect your account"** in red text. This means:

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Connect Your Gmail Account

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **In your EmailJS dashboard** (the screen you showed):
   - Click the **"Connect Account"** button (blue button)
   
2. **Sign in with Gmail**:
   - Choose **intelleeo.inteligence@gmail.com**
   - Click "Allow" to give EmailJS permission
   
3. **Complete the connection**:
   - You should see a green checkmark or "Connected"
   - The red message should disappear
   
4. **Click "Create Service"** (bottom right blue button)

5. **Verify the connection**:
   - Go back to Email Services
   - Your Gmail service should show as "Active" or "Connected"

## 🔄 After Connecting Gmail:

### Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

**Important:** Changes to `.env` file only load when you START the server, not while it's running!
